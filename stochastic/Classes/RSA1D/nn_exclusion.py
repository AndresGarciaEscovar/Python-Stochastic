        - self.attemps: An integer that represents the number of attempts at
          adsorbing a particle.

        - self.attempts_successful: An integer that represents the number of
          successful attempts at adsorbing a particle.

        - self.generator: The random number generator.

        - self.lattice: A list that represents the lattice where the particles
          live.

        - self.lattice_file: The name of the file where the lattice must be
          printed.

        - self.length: A positive integer that represents the length of the
          lattice.

        - self.maximum_time: The maximum time for which the simulation must be
          run.

        - self.repetitions: The number of times the simulation must be run to
          get statistically significant data.

        - self.seed: The seed to seed the random number generator.

        - self.statistics_table: The list where the statistics are kept.

        - self.tolerance: The tolerance to compare the floating point numbers.
