# 1D Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) of Dimers

## Index

## Introduction

Random sequential adsorption (RSA) is a fundamental process in which particles
are irreversibly, and randomly, deposited onto a substrate. Once particles are
deposited, they cannot be removed or rearranged. As particles are added, the
subtrate becomes populated and eventually saturates, reaching a state where no
more particles can be added due to the constraints of the system.

RSA has been widely used to model various physical, chemical, and biological
processes, such as the adsorption of molecules on surfaces, the packing of
colloidal particles, and the formation of thin films. RSA is useful to
understand some litography techniques where the deposition process follows a
random sequential adsorption mechanism.
